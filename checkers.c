/* Project overview:
  
  use the grid made by myself for chess project
  
  design the game board with pawns (blue and red [for readability])

  pieces might be represented by star characters
  queen pieces can be distinguished by capital Q character
  capturing pieces might be notated with x
  promotion is notated by move and Q and square name
  notation to be implemented (numerical squares notation)

  to enter a move the whole sequence has to be entered, so
  the input stream has to be read and interpreted by the program
