PROGRAM DESIGN:

Define:
- pieces positions and piese colors with two arrays,
  one for the piece and one for the color (distinguish the
  basic pieces and queens)
- notate the takes each by each, co in multiple capture
  all the partial moves have to be notated
- if any of the players can't move it's a draw

optional:
- add notation, although is mostly informal (consider adding notation)
